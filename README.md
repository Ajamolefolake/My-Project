This repository contains data analysis projects focused on two main datasets: Airline data and Global Superstore data. The analysis primarily uses Power BI for visualization, exploration, and deriving insights from these datasets.
Explore the dataset from the excel and turn it to csv then import to powerbi files provided to visualize and analyze the insights.
I transformed the data in Power BI for both data sets by importing the data sets ('airline_data.csv' and 'global_superstore_data.csv')into Power Bi
Used Power Query Editor to remove duplicates and handle missing and empty columns to ensure clarity and consistency, formatted data types appropriately for analysis.
Merged relevant tables to consolidate information created calculated column to derive new insights.
Applied filters to focus on specific subsets of data.
Structured the data to fit the required format for effective analysis in Power BI
Ensured the data was clean and consistent and ready for visualization
